# Dungeon-Saga
Group Project for CPSC4360. It was made with a group that did not know how to use Github, the work schedule and work load was complicated. 
That being said, there are many flaws inside this code thanks to both its rushed nature and poor group communication. I still feel it important to show it on my page as a way to point at my mistakes, and compare it to my other, more thought out, work.
